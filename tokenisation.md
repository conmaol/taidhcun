# Notes on tokenisation

Basic principles:
- Spaces are token separators.
- Punctuation markers are tokens.

Exceptions:
- Strings representing initial mutations are part of the following word token: 
  - t-
  - h-
  - n-
  - dh’
- The following are word tokens:
  - a’ – the definite article or progressive particle
  
  - truncated words like bhail’
  - a-muigh etc.
  - ann am, ann an – reduplicated prepositions
  - ’Se, b’ann, etc.

But not:
- do’n – ‘to the’ – this is two tokens


Rules for displaying text:
- Punctuation markers join to the preceding token. 

Other things than tokenisation
- empty words
  - <null-prep> aon latha
- grammatical relations
  - deep relations
